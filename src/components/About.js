      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed text-gray-700">
       I’m a Software Tester with a strong foundation in manual testing and a growing focus on automation.
I enjoy finding edge cases, improving software quality, and building reliable automated test suites using tools like Selenium, Playwright, TestNG, and Postman.
Passionate about learning modern testing tools and best practices, I’m always exploring better ways to ensure bug-free, user-friendly applications.
Currently transitioning into automation testing, I enjoy contributing to real-world projects and continuously upskilling in test frameworks and CI/CD workflows.
